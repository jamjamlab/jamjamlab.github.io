    This is a place for my personal blog page. The page's structual integrity is composed of HTML &amp; CSS. A little bit of javascript is added to essentially pull &amp; bind the content from my <a href="http://codepen.io/jamwjam/">CodePen's </a> Blog <a href="http://codepen.io/jamwjam/blog/feed/">RSS feed</a>. It's constantly under improvement so don't scrutinize it for too long! If you want to see the implementations, refer to this link: <a href="http://codepen.io/jamwjam/pen/XJNJWZ">http://codepen.io/jamwjam/pen/XJNJWZ</a>
