            <p>There are exciting technologies out there for me to learn and explore! While not always, and when I'm not tired, I like to research, tweak, and implement things that fasinates me. </p>
            <p>Here are the following topics that I'm currently playing around with:</p>

            <h3>Big Data</h3>
            I heard some person or thing state that content is king. I fullheartedly agree. After the exposure of big data through my role as a R&D intern, I realized the importance of content and data, and how it will ever-expand in the later years. 
            <h3>Mobile App Development</h3>
              <p>I started out mobile application development realizing that even I could publish an app. Amazing!</p>
            <h3>Website Design</h3>
            <p>I have been interested in website development and design ever since I found out building one was well  within my capabilities! </p>
            <p>Of course, another reason for makeing website is that most tools/services are free!</p>
