            <hr><p>Welcome to my portfolio. I'm Jung Kim (James), a Computer Science undergraduate and a senior at University of Maryland, College Park.</p>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>One of my motive for this website was to not only build to impress, but also to provide proven value in the things I do; this portfolio reveals the validity to the words that I put into my resume - to prove the readers that I really can do things!</p>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>This website is happily and skillfully hand-crafted by James! Web-design and development, since beginning of college I've always thought it would be cool to have an online-portfolio of my own.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>There are exciting technologies out there for me to learn and explore! While not always, and when I'm not tired, I like to research, tweak, and implement things that fasinates me. </p>
            <p>Here are the following topics that I'm currently playing around with:</p>
            <h3>Big Data</h3>
            <p>My second internship exposed me to the world of Big Data and it has been a special portion in my topic of interest ever since. <p/>
            <p>As a team contributor of developers and problem solvers, I had fun learning, as well as experiening my time to handle very large data sets, with intriguing tasks including: data mining and querying Hadoop, researching ad-hoc querying tools over HBase and providing documentations for others to follow.</p>    
            <h3>Website Design</h3>
            <p>I have been interested in website development and design ever since I found out building one was well within my capabilities! </p>
            <p>Of course, another reason for makeing website is that most tools/services are free!</p>
            <h3>Mobile App Development</h3>
            <p>I started out mobile application development realizing that even I could publish an app. Amazing!</p>
