            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Welcome to my portfolio. I'm James Kim, a Software Engineer at <a href="http://perfectsensedigital.com">

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>My motive for building this website was to not only to impress, but also to provide proven value and results in the things I do.</p>
            <p>In my case, this portfolio reveals the validity to the words that I put into my resume - to prove the readers that I really can do things!</p>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>This website is happily and skillfully hand-crafted by James! Since beginning of college, I've always thought it would be cool to have an online-portfolio of my own.</p>
            <p>It's built with a little bit of HTML, CSS, a little bit of Javascript, and used several useful (and awesome) technologies to create this website and publish into the web!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> - Allows users of GitHub to host their own webpage</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> - Static site generator</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.brackets.io">Brackets</a> - Open source code editor</li>
                <li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> - CSS framework</li>
                <li><a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS/SCSS</a> - Synthetically Awesome Style Sheets. Give it a try!</li>

            <h1><span><i class="fa fa-thumb-tack"></i></span> Interests</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>There are exciting technologies out there for me to learn and explore! While not always, and when I'm not tired, I like to research, tweak, and implement things that fasinates me. </p>
            <h3>Big Data</h3>
            <p>As a team contributor surrounded with developers and problem solvers, I enjoyed learning and involving my time handling very large data sets, working with intriguing tasks including: data mining and querying Hadoop, researching ad-hoc querying tools over HBase and providing documentations for others to follow.</p>
            <h3>Website Design</h3>
            <p>I have been interested in website development and design ever since I found out building one was well within my capabilities! </p>
            <p>Another driving motivation for makeing website is that most tools I've used did not cost anything at all! These materials either have free-tier plans or were open source.</p>
            <h3>Android Development</h3>
            <p>My interests in mobile development originated in my freshmen year in UMD College Park. At first, I began to tinker around with Windows Phone 7 development. This then established my background in C#, Visual Studio and soon enough, ultimately transitioned into Android development.</p>
            <p>Today, my experience in mobile development is getting ever more useful. Take for intance, the Human Computer Interaction course in UMD. Knowledge in this field helped my big time as our semester long project was building a sensor-focused mobile application!</p>

            <p>Here are some fancy charts I made with the help of <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> and <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API</a> to better visualize where I stand. Here's my <a href="http://codepen.io/jamwjam/pen/pJNevO">source code</a> if you're curious.</p>

            <p>Here's the deal (<span style="font-weight:bold">disclaimer!</span>): The following charts above does not solely reflect my programming expertise and/or language knowledgebase.</p>
            <p>But it sure looks cool!</p>
