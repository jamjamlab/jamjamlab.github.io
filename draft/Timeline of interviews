Here's a list of interviews I took over the years. I thought it would be pretty nice reflect these events. Maybe have a blog post of their own in the future? I'm inclined to create a reflection post at their anniversary.

Some of the interviews (especially the earlier ones) has been the most cringe-worthy events, now that I started to look back by looking at old emails applying to these places. Hopefully unravelling the past isn't too bad. It's already making my stomach hurt.
