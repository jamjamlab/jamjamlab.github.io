To start off I felt I needed more pjazz on the main page of my website.

In addition, its a good first step for me due to several reasons:

 * Learn to utilize d3.js - d3 will come very handy later for visualizing data and on-the-go svg graphics
 * Make my website more pretty
 * It's fun

Something that catches the eye of readers! Something that symbolizeds my interst in networking new people... So a wifi symbol. 

Here's the list of step I took to make this symbol a reality.

## Step 1: drawing it out

To begin with I started with skeches; I guess I didn't need this step after all, but here it is:

But you get the idea. I will be going for somthing very minimal and universal.

## Step 2: download d3.js and required components 

You can download d3.js here: 


## Step 3: 

{% highlight js %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
